  Merry Christmas!
</h1>

A wordle clone / more interesting way to present christmas gift cards. Mostly ripped from [this](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle) repo. The idea is to have QR codes in the box with the codes on them, and then recipients have to solve the wordle to find out where the code goes.
